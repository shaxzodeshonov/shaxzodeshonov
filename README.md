### Hi there 👋 I'm Shaxzod

I'm a Computer Science student studying in Tashkent, Uzbekistan.

Over the past few years, I've focused on programming fundamentals, algorithms, and building real-world software. I'm especially interested in AI, systems, and practical tools that solve problems. These days, I'm focused on becoming a strong engineer and preparing for AI-related projects.

#### 🔭 I'm currently working on ...
Personal tools and automation scripts — small software that saves time and improves workflow.
Machine learning experiments — learning models, math, and implementing things from scratch.
